# FlyTracker

installation:

> create images from video using GetFramesFromVideo.py
  >> change video name and output directories accordingly
  
> create tracked frames from video image frames using TrackFly.py
  >> output is one mask frame per video frame with object (fly) at 255 and background at 0
  >> Note: I hard-wired a cropping to remove the ruler on the left side and some noise at the top
  
> Example outputs for video: 3 f20-d2-6-recovery-best-fall-from-ceiling-transition to forward-flight.avi
